Streaming vs Batch Processing

1. Streaming Processing
   What is it?
   Streaming (or real-time) processing means handling data as soon as it arrives, often in small pieces (events, messages, or records).

When is Streaming Better?

Real-time logs: Monitoring server logs for errors as they happen.
Video processing: Live video filters, real-time video analytics, or streaming video to users.
Fraud detection: Detecting suspicious transactions instantly.
Live dashboards: Showing up-to-the-second metrics.
How does it work?
Data flows continuously through the system. Each event is processed as soon as it arrives.

Tools:

Kafka: Distributed event streaming platform, great for high-throughput, real-time pipelines.
RabbitMQ: Message broker for passing messages between services in real-time.
Apache Flink, Apache Storm, Spark Streaming: For complex real-time data processing. 2. Batch Processing
What is it?
Batch processing means collecting data over a period of time, then processing it all at once.

When is Batch Better?

ETL jobs: Extract, Transform, Load jobs that move and clean large amounts of data (e.g., nightly database updates).
Analytics: Generating daily, weekly, or monthly reports.
Data backups: Copying or archiving large datasets at scheduled times.
Billing: Calculating monthly bills for all users at once.
How does it work?
Data is stored until a certain amount or time has passed, then processed in one go.

Tools:

Apache Hadoop: Classic batch processing framework.
Apache Spark: Can do both batch and streaming, but often used for batch analytics.
AWS Glue, Google Dataflow: Managed ETL and batch processing services.
